# HCAPForestModel
An R script that will read in HCAP data and perform Decision, Regression, and Forest Tree analysis



  Previous work has been done with the HCAP data using the traditional statistical methods: Clean Data, explore data [via correlations, covariance, what have you], liner regressions. However, as phase two begins, a second and new method will be tried. That of Tree's. R currently has the best implementation of trees that I am currently aware of.
  
  This repository is host the R script to perform the analysis so that it may be reviewed and corrected by others.
