# HCAPForestModel
An R script that will read in HCAP data and perform Decision, Regression, and Forest Tree analysis



  Previous work has been done with the HCAP data using the traditional statistical methods: Clean Data, explore data [via correlations, covariance, what have you], liner regressions. However, as phase two begins, a second and new method will be tried. That of Tree's. R currently has the best implementation of trees that I am currently aware of.
  
  This repository is host the R script to perform the analysis so that it may be reviewed and corrected by others. 
  

Note about setup:
  HCAPForestModel.R is used to set the working directory to a diffrent location than what is currently specified in RStudio. HCAPForestModel.R is saved in c:/scripts/R and the main R script will look for it and execute it. IF it can't find it, it will just use what the default working directory is.
